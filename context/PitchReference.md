## üö´ Why 90% of Pitches Fail

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1. **No Hook**
   - The pitch doesn't grab attention in the first 15 seconds
   - Opening fails to intrigue or engage judges immediately

2. **No Trust**
   - Founders speak in future hopes instead of present facts
   - Using conditional language undermines credibility

3. **No Real Pain**
   - The problem is unclear, soft, or not worth solving
   - Impact and urgency aren't evident

4. **Cluttered Slides**
   - Dense visuals and too much text killing clarity
   - Information overload prevents message retention

5. **Nothing Memorable**
   - Judges don't remember your most important message
   - No standout moment or hook that sticks

---

## ‚ùå Language to AVOID in Your Pitch

### Don't Use These Words/Phrases

| ‚ùå **AVOID** | ‚úÖ **USE INSTEAD** |
|-------------|-------------------|
| **Uncertainty verbs:** "trying," "hoping," "imagining" | Ban them entirely |
| **Conditional forms:** "would," "should," "could," "might" | Use "what we do" instead |
| **Future tense** | Use present tense |

### Why This Matters

- Uncertain language destroys credibility
- Conditional forms make you sound hypothetical
- Future tense suggests you haven't built anything yet
- Present tense shows confidence and existing execution

**Example Transformation:**
- ‚ùå "We hope to build a solution that could help users..."
- ‚úÖ "We built a solution that helps users..."
