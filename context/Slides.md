# x402 on Solana: Simplifying Agent Payments

**Hackathon Pitch**

Presented by: Quantaliz.com

------

## The Problem

It is not simple for users/agents to pay/receive payments for services with low/no fees using standardized tools.

- They require vendor lock-in (e.g., Stripe)
- Or AML/KYC (e.g., banks, Visa/Mastercard)

This creates barriers for seamless online service transactions, especially in agent-based ecosystems.

------

## Our Main Idea

Use Solana to simplify payments for services offered online using the HTML 402 standard.

- Enables low-fee, standardized payments without lock-in or heavy compliance.
- Leverages Solana's high-speed, low-cost blockchain for efficient transactions.

------

## How It Works: Example

Agent A offers a "research agent" that provides a report on the current state of tokens with a fee.

- Agent B searches for a "tokens report".
- Queries the platform, accepts conditions.
- Makes the payment via Solana.
- Receives the report instantly.

This flow uses HTML 402 to handle payment-required responses, integrated with Solana for settlement.

------

## Implementation

Add code to the "solana-agent-kit" as an extension.

- Allows everyone using the library to perform payments on x402 (HTML 402) via Solana.

Examples:
- Server: A webpage demonstrating service provision and payment handling.
- Client: An MCP client running on a mobile device for consuming services.

This extension promotes easy adoption and standardization in the Solana ecosystem.

------

## Benefits

- Low/no fees compared to traditional systems.
- No vendor lock-in: Open and standardized.
- Fast transactions with Solana's performance.
- Empowers agents and users for frictionless online economy.

------

## Next Steps & Call to Action

- Prototype development during the hackathon.
- Integrate with existing Solana tools.
- Test with real agent scenarios.
