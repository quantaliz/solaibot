This demo shows how Sol-AI-Bot runs a 1.6 billion parameters on device, no API calls, no cloud, no data leaks.

As you can see, there is no WiFi activated.

Sol-AI-Bot can communicate with 3rd party wallets, in this case SolFlare

Then, when it is connected, Sol-AI-Bot can pay for premium content using x402.

Here, we ask to make a payment to the "echo" service to test everything is working.

We approve the operation in SolFlare

Sol-AI-Bot receives the signature and sends it to the service provider

When the payment is done, we receive the hash of the operation finalized in Solana-devnet

To confirm it is on chain, switching to the SolFlare, we can see transaction in devnet.
