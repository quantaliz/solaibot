## OPENING (0:00-0:15)

**[Visual: Phone screen with AI chat, then payment notification pops up]**

**Narrator:**

"Your AI assistant is smart. It can answer questions, help with tasks, even write code.

But here's the problem: it can't pay for anything.

**[Screen freezes, red X appears]**

It's brilliant... but broke."

## THE PROBLEM (0:15-0:35)

**[Visual: Split screen showing cloud servers, exposed data, manual payment flows]**

**Narrator:**

"Traditional AI assistants have three big problems:

One: Your private conversations get sent to the cloud. Every question. Every prompt.

Two: They can't autonomously pay for services. Want your AI to access paid APIs? You have to intervene. Every. Single. Time.

Three: You either give them no control... or too much. There's no safe middle ground."

## THE SOLUTION (0:35-0:55)

**[Visual: SolAIBot logo animates in, phone running the app]**

**Narrator:**

"Meet SolAIBot.

**[Visual: Brain icon on phone, processing locally]**

It runs a full AI model right on your phone. Nothing leaves your device. Complete privacy.

**[Visual: Payment flow animation with Solana logo]**

And here's the magic: it can autonomously pay for content using Solana blockchain.

When your AI needs paid data, it detects it, requests your approval through your wallet, and completes the payment — all in under a second."

## HOW IT WORKS (0:55-1:25)

**[Visual: Screen recording of SolAIBot in action]**

**Narrator:**

"Watch this.

**[Phone screen: User asks question]**

You ask your AI a question. It finds a premium data source.

**[Payment challenge appears]**

Instead of hitting a wall, your AI agent automatically initiates a Solana micropayment.

**[Wallet opens for approval]**

Your trusted wallet—like Solflare—pops up for approval. Tap once.

**[Transaction completes, AI responds with data]**

Payment confirmed in 400 milliseconds. Your AI gets the data and answers your question.

No manual intervention. No breaking your workflow. Just seamless AI autonomy."

## THE TECH (1:25-1:45)

**[Visual: Technical architecture diagram, simplified]**

**Narrator:**

"The tech behind this is impressive:

On-device AI inference using an open model. That's powerful enough to understand context and make decisions.

Mobile Wallet Adapter keeps your private keys secure. The app never sees them.

And Solana's blazing-fast blockchain makes micropayments actually viable for the first time in human history.

**[Visual: x402 protocol icon]**

We implemented the x402 payment protocol — elevate Android with local AI."

## BEYOND MOBILE (1:45-2:05)

**[Visual: Desktop, servers, multiple devices]**

**Narrator:**

"But we didn't stop at mobile.

**[Visual: Solana Agent Kit logo and code]**

We built a toolkit for ANY AI agent—on servers, desktops, or cloud platforms.

Want your Node.js bot to pay for APIs? Your Claude Desktop assistant to access premium data? Your automated trading agent to subscribe to real-time feeds?

Our x402 Payments Plugin makes it possible. Drop it into any AI framework—LangChain, OpenAI, Vercel AI SDK—and your agents can pay autonomously."

## THE VISION (2:05-2:25)

**[Visual: Network of AI agents transacting with each other]**

**Narrator:**

"Imagine an economy where AI agents buy services from other agents.

Where developers can monetize their APIs without complex payment systems.

Where privacy and autonomy aren't trade-offs—they're guaranteed.

**[Visual: SolAIBot and toolkit together]**

That's what we're building. Privacy-first AI that's truly autonomous."

## CALL TO ACTION (2:25-2:40)

**[Visual: Download buttons, GitHub repos, logos]**

**Narrator:**

"SolAIBot is available now. Free download. Open source.

The agent toolkit is ready for developers. Full documentation. Working examples.

**[Visual: Cypherpunk and Hackaroo logos]**

Built for Cypherpunk 2025 and Hackaroo 2025.

**[Visual: Quantaliz logo]**

This is Quantaliz. Where privacy-first AI meets Solana speed.

Download. Build. Join us."

## CLOSING (2:40-2:45)

**[Visual: Fade to logo with tagline]**

**Text on screen:**
**"Financially Autonomous AI Agents"**
**"Privacy-First • Solana-Powered • Available Now"**

**Narrator:**

"Your AI just got a wallet."

**[End]**

## VISUAL NOTES

- **Color scheme:** Dark backgrounds with purple and orange accents (brand colors)
- **Animation style:** Smooth, modern, tech-forward
- **Key moments to emphasize:**
  - The "freeze" when showing AI can't pay
  - The speed of payment approval (show actual timestamp)
  - The wallet popup (real Solflare interface)
  - The network effect of agents transacting

## AUDIO NOTES

- **Music:** Upbeat electronic, builds gradually
- **SFX:** Subtle tech sounds for animations
- **Payment completion:** Satisfying "ding" or success sound
- **Pace:** Energetic but clear, give breathing room for visuals
