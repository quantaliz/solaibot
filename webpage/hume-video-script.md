## ANNOTATION STRATEGY SUMMARY

### Emotional Arc
1. **Opening (Friendly)** → Conversational hook
2. **Problem (Concerned)** → Build tension and frustration
3. **Solution (Excited)** → Relief and enthusiasm
4. **Demo (Confident)** → Showcase smooth operation
5. **Tech (Professional)** → Establish credibility
6. **Beyond (Expansive)** → Show broader vision
7. **Vision (Inspiring)** → Paint the future
8. **CTA (Urgent)** → Drive action
9. **Close (Memorable)** → Leave impact

### Speed Variations
- **Slow (0.90-0.95)**: Important technical details, emphasis points, dramatic moments
- **Normal (1.0)**: Standard narration, clear explanations
- **Fast (1.05-1.15)**: Excitement, lists, energy, call to action

### Key Pauses
- `[pause]`: Before important words, between list items, for rhythm
- `[long pause]`: Before major revelations, emphasizing contrasts
- `trailing_silence`: Between segments for visual transitions

### Emphasis Points
1. **"can't pay for anything"** - Core problem (pause before)
2. **"Every. Single. Time."** - Frustration (pauses between words)
3. **"Complete privacy"** - Key benefit (pause before)
4. **"400 milliseconds"** - Impressive speed (slightly faster delivery)
5. **"never sees them"** - Security promise (pause before)
6. **"first time in human history"** - Historical significance (emphatic)
7. **"ANY AI agent"** - Universal applicability (emphasize with volume)
8. **"guaranteed"** - Strong promise (slow, confident)
9. **"Download. Build. Join us."** - Action commands (pauses between)

### Continuation Strategy
- Group related ideas together in single utterances
- Maintain emotional consistency within each major section
- Use continuation between segments within the same section
- Reset emotional tone between major section transitions (Problem → Solution, Tech → Vision)

### Technical Notes
- Total of 9 major segments for generation
- Request word-level timestamps for synchronizing with visuals
- Consider generating sections 2-3 segments at a time for natural continuation
- Reset voice between major tonal shifts (Problem to Solution, Demo to Tech)

---

## PRODUCTION WORKFLOW

1. **Generate in batches** with continuation:
   - Batch 1: Opening (2 utterances)
   - Batch 2: Problem (4 utterances with continuation)
   - Batch 3: Solution (4 utterances with continuation)
   - Batch 4: Demo (6 utterances with continuation)
   - Batch 5: Tech (5 utterances with continuation)
   - Batch 6: Beyond Mobile (4 utterances with continuation)
   - Batch 7: Vision (4 utterances with continuation)
   - Batch 8: CTA (5 utterances with continuation)
   - Batch 9: Closing (1 utterance)

2. **Request word timestamps** for all segments to sync with visuals

3. **Stitch together** with natural transitions preserved by continuation

4. **Verify timing** against visual cues using timestamps
