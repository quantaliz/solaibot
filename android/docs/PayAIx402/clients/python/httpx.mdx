## Getting started with httpx

Make x402 payments with an httpx client in 2 minutes.

<Note>You can find the full code for this example [here](https://github.com/coinbase/x402/tree/main/examples/python/clients/httpx).</Note>

### Step 1: Install dependencies

```bash
pip install httpx eth-account x402 python-dotenv
```

### Step 2: Set your environment variables

```bash
echo "RESOURCE_SERVER_URL=http://localhost:4021\nENDPOINT_PATH=/weather\nPRIVATE_KEY=..." > .env
```

Your `.env` file should look like this:

```
RESOURCE_SERVER_URL=http://localhost:4021
ENDPOINT_PATH=/weather
PRIVATE_KEY=... # your private key
```

### Step 3: Create a new httpx client

```python main.py lines icon="python"
import os
import asyncio
from dotenv import load_dotenv
from eth_account import Account
from x402.clients.httpx import x402HttpxClient
from x402.clients.base import decode_x_payment_response, x402Client

# Load environment variables
load_dotenv()

# Get environment variables
private_key = os.getenv("PRIVATE_KEY")
base_url = os.getenv("RESOURCE_SERVER_URL")
endpoint_path = os.getenv("ENDPOINT_PATH")

if not all([private_key, base_url, endpoint_path]):
    print("Error: Missing required environment variables")
    exit(1)

# Create eth_account from private key
account = Account.from_key(private_key)
print(f"Initialized account: {account.address}")


def custom_payment_selector(
    accepts, network_filter=None, scheme_filter=None, max_value=None
):
    """Custom payment selector that filters by network."""
    # Ignore the network_filter parameter for this example - we hardcode base-sepolia
    _ = network_filter

    # NOTE: In a real application, you'd want to dynamically choose the most
    # appropriate payment requirement based on user preferences, available funds,
    # network conditions, or other business logic rather than hardcoding a network.

    # Filter by base-sepolia network (testnet)
    return x402Client.default_payment_requirements_selector(
        accepts,
        network_filter="base-sepolia",
        scheme_filter=scheme_filter,
        max_value=max_value,
    )


async def main():
    # Create x402HttpxClient with built-in payment handling and network filtering
    async with x402HttpxClient(
        account=account,
        base_url=base_url,
        payment_requirements_selector=custom_payment_selector,
    ) as client:
        # Make request - payment handling is automatic
        try:
            assert endpoint_path is not None  # we already guard against None above
            print(f"Making request to {endpoint_path}")
            response = await client.get(endpoint_path)

            # Read the response content
            content = await response.aread()
            print(f"Response: {content.decode()}")

            # Check for payment response header
            if "X-Payment-Response" in response.headers:
                payment_response = decode_x_payment_response(
                    response.headers["X-Payment-Response"]
                )
                print(
                    f"Payment response transaction hash: {payment_response['transaction']}"
                )
            else:
                print("Warning: No payment response header found")

        except Exception as e:
            print(f"Error occurred: {str(e)}")


if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

### Step 4: Run the client

```bash
python main.py
```

<Check>
  Your client is now making x402 payments!
</Check>

### Step 5: Test the client

You can test payments against a local server by running the [fastapi example](https://github.com/coinbase/x402/tree/main/examples/python/servers/fastapi) or the [flask example](https://github.com/coinbase/x402/tree/main/examples/python/servers/flask) from the x402 repository.  

Just set your environment variables to match your local server, install the dependencies, and run the examples.

<Note>You can also test your client against PayAI's [live Echo Merchant](https://x402.payai.network) for free. You will receive a full refund of any tokens that you send, and PayAI will pay for the network fees.</Note>
