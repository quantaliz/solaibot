## Why use x402 with your client

x402 standardizes how clients discover payment requirements, construct payment payloads, and complete on-chain payments for HTTP resources. Benefits include:

✅ Customers don't pay network fees.  
✅ Merchants don't pay network fees.  
✅ Payment settles in < 1 second.  
✅ Universal compatibility -- if it speaks HTTP, it speaks x402.

## Architecture at a glance

![x402 sequence diagram](/images/x402-sequence-diagram.svg)

- **Client (buyer)**: Calls protected resources and constructs payment payloads.
- **Server**: Advertises payment requirements, verifies/settles payments, fulfills requests.
- **Facilitator**: Verifies and/or settles payments for the resource server.
- **Blockchains**: Execute and confirm payments.
