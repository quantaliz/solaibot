## Why use an x402 facilitator

Facilitators provide shared infrastructure for verifying and settling on-chain payments for HTTP resources using the x402 protocol. They abstract multi-chain complexity, offer a consistent API for resource servers, and enable better reliability, observability, and reuse across multiple merchants and apps.

- Consistent verification and settlement across schemes and networks
- Offload blockchain operations and complexity from resource servers
- Serve multiple merchants/apps via a stable `/verify` and `/settle` API
- Help clients discover merchants via the `/list` endpoint

## Architecture at a glance

![x402 sequence diagram](/images/x402-sequence-diagram.svg)

- Client: Calls protected resources and constructs payment payloads.
- Resource Server: Advertises payment requirements, verifies/settles payments, fulfills requests.
- Facilitator Server: Verifies payment payloads and executes settlements via standard endpoints.
- Blockchain Networks: Execute and confirm payments.

### Payment flow (facilitator perspective)

From the facilitatorâ€™s point of view, the key steps of the protocol are:

1. Resource server sends a POST to the facilitator `/verify` endpoint with the Payment Payload and the Payment Requirements selected by the client.
2. Facilitator validates the payload according to the scheme and network (e.g., signatures, amounts, nonces) and returns a Verification Response.
3. When the server is ready to execute the payment, it sends a POST to the facilitator `/settle` endpoint with the Payment Payload and Payment Requirements.
4. Facilitator submits the transaction to the blockchain for the specified scheme/network, waits for confirmation, and returns a Payment Execution Response.

## Facilitator responsibilities

- Expose secure `/verify` and `/settle` endpoints that follow x402 request/response shapes
- Validate Payment Payloads per scheme and network; prevent replay and ensure idempotency
- Submit on-chain transactions for settlement and monitor confirmations
- Provide clear error responses for verification or settlement failures
- Maintain supported network coverage and RPC/wallet infrastructure
- Implement observability (logs/metrics/traces), rate limiting, retries, and alerting

## Getting started
