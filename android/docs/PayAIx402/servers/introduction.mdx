## Monetize your API with x402

x402 lets you monetize HTTP APIs and content with on-chain payments, while keeping your existing server stack. 

Benefits:

✅ Merchants don't pay network fees.  
✅ Customers don't pay network fees.  
✅ Payment settles in < 1 second.  
✅ Universal compatibility -- if it speaks HTTP, it speaks x402.

## Architecture at a glance

![x402 sequence diagram](/images/x402-sequence-diagram.svg)

- **Client**: Calls your protected resource and submits payments.
- **Server (merchant)**: Advertises payment requirements, verifies payments, fulfills requests, and settles payments.
- **Facilitator**: Verifies and/or settles payments on your behalf via standard endpoints.
- **Blockchain**: Where payments are executed and confirmed.
