What's my solana balance?


Can you make a payment to the https://x402.payai.network/api/solana-devnet/paid-content

SolAIBot needs to support x402 with solana. The use case is, when the user asks the LLM to make a payment to a certain url, the LLM makes a "FUNCTION_CALL" to "solana_payment" with the URL. Once code receives this request, it follows the HTTP requests outlined in the x402 documentation. A key difference will be, SolAIBot will prepare all the requirements of the request, then use the MWA to retrieve a signed payload, which is then sent to the x402 endpoint.
Use all the code necessary to prepare this flow from "docs/Coinbasex402/java/src/main/java/com/coinbase/x402", review what's there and bring it to SolAIBot
Use the "https://x402.payai.network" to test this new flow
Check the "docs/CBx402.md" if more details are necessary for details.

I ran the app on the phone, it correctly identifies the "solana_payment" function, but it tells me "Payment declined", which was already setup as the @log.txt shows. It returns "Failed to access resource: HTTP 402" which should be captured as part of the payment flow, where the "result" has a "{"x402Version":1,"error":"invalid_exact_svm_payload_transaction","accepts":[{"scheme":"exact","network":"solana-devnet","maxAmountRequired":"10000","resource":"https://x402.payai.network/api/solana-devnet/paid-content","description":"Access to protected content on solana devnet","mimeType":"","payTo":"2wKupLR9q6wXYppw8Gr2NvWxKBUqm4PPJKkQfoxHDBg4","maxTimeoutSeconds":60,"asset":"4zMMC9srt5Ri5X14GAgXhaHii3GnPAEERYPJgZJDncDU","outputSchema":{"input":{"type":"http","method":"GET"}},"extra":{"feePayer":"2wKupLR9q6wXYppw8Gr2NvWxKBUqm4PPJKkQfoxHDBg4"}}]}"

Yesterday, we were working on documenting this new feature, @docs/x402-SolAIBot.md has all the actions needed to implement it. The path to follow will be to depend the "sol4k" library for SolAIBot to have full control over transaction building

but it is still a work in progress. First, I want you to review the documentation at @docs/PayAIx402/introduction.mdx and @docs/PayAIx402/reference.mdx
With those documents, create a metal map of how the x402 protocol works first. With that mental map create a new reference document (docs/x402-Solaibot.md) on how it should be implemented in this project. Consider that @docs/x402-integration.md and @docs/x402-status.md were reports yesterday generated.


I've successfully integrated the x402 payment protocol infrastructure into SolAIBot, but there's a critical piece still needed: proper Solana transaction building.

  What's Complete ✅

  1. All x402 protocol code:
    - Data models (PaymentRequirements, PaymentPayload, SettlementResponse)
    - Facilitator API client
    - HTTP client with 402 handling
    - OkHttp dependency added
  2. LLM integration:
    - solana_payment function declaration
    - Function routing fixed (your bug)
    - Async wallet handling
  3. Payment flow:
    - Initial request → 402 ✅
    - Parse requirements ✅
    - Connect wallet ✅
    - Sign transaction ✅

  What's Missing ❌

  Transaction building - The current implementation creates placeholder transactions that the facilitator rejects with invalid_exact_svm_payload_transaction.

  A valid Solana transaction needs:
  - Recent blockhash from RPC
  - Proper SPL token transfer instructions
  - Associated token account derivation
  - Compute budget instructions
  - Correct serialization

  Why It's Hard

  Android lacks mature Solana transaction libraries. The available options require either:
  1. Server-side building (recommended) - Add a backend service
  2. WebView bridge - Embed JavaScript @solana/web3.js
  3. Native Kotlin port - Significant development effort
  4. Solana Blinks pattern - Requires protocol changes

  Documentation Created

  - /proj/docs/x402-integration.md - Full technical documentation
  - /proj/docs/x402-status.md - Current status and next steps

  The infrastructure is solid and ready. Once you choose an approach for transaction building and implement it, the entire x402 flow will work end-to-end.

Now check the code "@docs/Coinbasex402/java/src/main/java" and tell me if they are already doing the PDA->SPL->ATA with the JAVA code they have there. Then answer if that could be transfered to SolAIBot to have control over the transaction building

When I tried again, it showed the Phantom wallet, first it showed a normal "connect" operation (even when I did it before sending the message to the LLM). Then, it asked for signature and returned to SolAIBot. Once there, it simply responded "Please try again later.". @log.txt has logging of the console.
Please, review how the typescript client implementation works out transaction signing from "docs/Coinbasex402/typescript/packages/x402" or the documentation on this feature implementation @docs/x402-SolAIBot.md

    Solaibot has compilation issues, @log shows which ones

The last changes interacting with the MWA wallet had a regression.The last changes interacting with the MWA wallet had a regression.
Still not working, the Phantom wallet showed only "connect" but no signing, I had to manually return to the SolAIBot app. @log.txt has logging of the console


To this point, it is very close to construct a valid transacton, however it is still not working. The Phantom wallet showed "connect" and it signed the transaction sent. Then MWA returned to SolAIBot. However, the messaged showed "The payment was declined..." @log.txt has logging of the console.
Do not try to compile the project, I am doing that in another computer. Do not try to create a test for these changes.

Currently, it is very close to construct a valid transacton, however not working yet.
@log.txt has logs of SolAIBot trying to make a payment to an endpoint but has errors.
There is a valid example at @docs/Coinbasex402/examples/typescript/clients/fetch/index.ts which is working and it shows the logs of execution at @docs/Coinbasex402/examples/typescript/clients/fetch/log.txt
Use this example as the base line to identify why the current code at SolAIBot fails to create a correct "X-PAYMENT" that is accepted by the service provider. Somehow, SolAIBot has a different singed payload in the "X-PAYMENT" with multiple "BQUF" strings which do not seem right compared to the example header.
The main file that has changed and is around thes operations is @app/src/main/java/com/quantaliz/solaibot/data/x402/SolanaPaymentBuilder.kt
If you need documentation/code samples of the MWA/x402/sol4k dependencies, there are clones of those repositories in the "docs/" folder.
Do not try to compile the project, I am doing that in another computer. Do not try to create a test for these changes, there are no unit/integration tests

It is still not working. Error messages are in @log.txt

I am trying to debug a "client" application that is connecting to a x402 server using the "echo" using:
RESOURCE_SERVER_URL=https://x402.payai.network
ENDPOINT_PATH=/api/solana-devnet/paid-content
But, I can't get enough information on why it returns HTTP 502 as a response. I want you to check this repository "examples/typescript" and tell me which "server" or "facilitator" can I run to get more logs from that help me debug the client application.
