What's my solana balance?


Can you make a payment to the https://x402.payai.network/api/solana-devnet/paid-content

SolAIBot needs to support x402 with solana. The use case is, when the user asks the LLM to make a payment to a certain url, the LLM makes a "FUNCTION_CALL" to "solana_payment" with the URL. Once code receives this request, it follows the HTTP requests outlined in the x402 documentation. A key difference will be, SolAIBot will prepare all the requirements of the request, then use the MWA to retrieve a signed payload, which is then sent to the x402 endpoint.
Use all the code necessary to prepare this flow from "docs/Coinbasex402/java/src/main/java/com/coinbase/x402", review what's there and bring it to SolAIBot
Use the "https://x402.payai.network" to test this new flow
Check the "docs/CBx402.md" if more details are necessary for details.

I ran the app on the phone, it correctly identifies the "solana_payment" function, but it tells me "Payment declined", which was already setup as the @log.txt shows. It returns "Failed to access resource: HTTP 402" which should be captured as part of the payment flow, where the "result" has a "{"x402Version":1,"error":"invalid_exact_svm_payload_transaction","accepts":[{"scheme":"exact","network":"solana-devnet","maxAmountRequired":"10000","resource":"https://x402.payai.network/api/solana-devnet/paid-content","description":"Access to protected content on solana devnet","mimeType":"","payTo":"2wKupLR9q6wXYppw8Gr2NvWxKBUqm4PPJKkQfoxHDBg4","maxTimeoutSeconds":60,"asset":"4zMMC9srt5Ri5X14GAgXhaHii3GnPAEERYPJgZJDncDU","outputSchema":{"input":{"type":"http","method":"GET"}},"extra":{"feePayer":"2wKupLR9q6wXYppw8Gr2NvWxKBUqm4PPJKkQfoxHDBg4"}}]}"

A key difference will be, SolAIBot will prepare all the requirements of the request, then use the MWA to retrieve a signed payload, which is then sent to the x402 endpoint.
Yesterday, we were working on documenting this new feature, @docs/x402-SolAIBot.md has all the actions needed to implement it. The path to follow will be to depend the "sol4k" library for SolAIBot to have full control over transaction building

but it is still a work in progress. First, I want you to review the documentation at @docs/PayAIx402/introduction.mdx and @docs/PayAIx402/reference.mdx
With those documents, create a metal map of how the x402 protocol works first. With that mental map create a new reference document (docs/x402-Solaibot.md) on how it should be implemented in this project. Consider that @docs/x402-integration.md and @docs/x402-status.md were reports yesterday generated.


I've successfully integrated the x402 payment protocol infrastructure into SolAIBot, but there's a critical piece still needed: proper Solana transaction building.

  What's Complete ✅

  1. All x402 protocol code:
    - Data models (PaymentRequirements, PaymentPayload, SettlementResponse)
    - Facilitator API client
    - HTTP client with 402 handling
    - OkHttp dependency added
  2. LLM integration:
    - solana_payment function declaration
    - Function routing fixed (your bug)
    - Async wallet handling
  3. Payment flow:
    - Initial request → 402 ✅
    - Parse requirements ✅
    - Connect wallet ✅
    - Sign transaction ✅

  What's Missing ❌

  Transaction building - The current implementation creates placeholder transactions that the facilitator rejects with invalid_exact_svm_payload_transaction.

  A valid Solana transaction needs:
  - Recent blockhash from RPC
  - Proper SPL token transfer instructions
  - Associated token account derivation
  - Compute budget instructions
  - Correct serialization

  Why It's Hard

  Android lacks mature Solana transaction libraries. The available options require either:
  1. Server-side building (recommended) - Add a backend service
  2. WebView bridge - Embed JavaScript @solana/web3.js
  3. Native Kotlin port - Significant development effort
  4. Solana Blinks pattern - Requires protocol changes

  Documentation Created

  - /proj/docs/x402-integration.md - Full technical documentation
  - /proj/docs/x402-status.md - Current status and next steps

  The infrastructure is solid and ready. Once you choose an approach for transaction building and implement it, the entire x402 flow will work end-to-end.


Host: https://x402.payai.network
Resource: /api/solana-devnet/paid-content

Now check the code "@docs/Coinbasex402/java/src/main/java" and tell me if they are already doing the PDA->SPL->ATA with the JAVA code they have there. Then answer if that could be transfered to SolAIBot to have control over the transaction building

When I tried again, it showed the Phantom wallet, first it showed a normal "connect" operation (even when I did it before sending the message to the LLM). Then, it asked for signature and returned to SolAIBot. Once there, it simply responded "Please try again later.". @log.txt has logging of the console.
Please, review how the typescript client implementation works out transaction signing from "docs/Coinbasex402/typescript/packages/x402" or the documentation on this feature implementation @docs/x402-SolAIBot.md

    Solaibot has compilation issues, @log.txt shows which ones

The last changes interacting with the MWA wallet had a regression.The last changes interacting with the MWA wallet had a regression.
Still not working, the Phantom wallet showed only "connect" but no signing, I had to manually return to the SolAIBot app. @log.txt has logging of the console


To this point, it is very close to construct a valid transacton, however it is still not working. The Phantom wallet showed "connect" and it signed the transaction sent. Then MWA returned to SolAIBot. However, the messaged showed "The payment was declined..." @log.txt has logging of the console.
Do not try to compile the project, I am doing that in another computer. Do not try to create a test for these changes.
If you need a reference implementation, review how the typescript client implementation works out transaction signing from "docs/Coinbasex402/typescript/packages/x402"


SolAIBot needs to support x402 with solana. The use case is, when the user asks the LLM to make a payment to a certain url, the LLM makes a "FUNCTION_CALL" to "solana_payment" with the URL. Once code receives this request, it responds to the HTTP x402 requests. A key difference will be, SolAIBot will prepare all the requirements of the request, then use the MWA to retrieve a signed payload, which is then sent to the x402 endpoint.
Currently, it is very close to construct a valid transacton, however not working yet.
@log.txt has the traces of SolAIBot trying to make a payment to an endpoint but has errors.
There is a valid example at @docs/Coinbasex402/examples/typescript/clients/fetch/index.ts which is working and it shows the logs of execution at @docs/Coinbasex402/examples/typescript/clients/fetch/log.txt
Use this example as the base line to identify why the current code at SolAIBot fails to create a correct "X-PAYMENT" that is accepted by the service provider. Somehow, SolAIBot has a different signed payload in the "X-PAYMENT", there is probably an issue with how the MWA is signing the payload
The main file that has changed and is around thes operations is @app/src/main/java/com/quantaliz/solaibot/data/x402/SolanaPaymentBuilder.kt
If you need documentation/code samples of the MWA/x402/sol4k dependencies, there are clones of those repositories in the "docs/" folder.
For example, @docs/mobile-wallet-adapter/README.md explains the MWA repository
There is a facilitator example here: @docs/Coinbasex402/examples/typescript/facilitator/index.ts
As documentation, @docs/x402-Header.md explains the basic outline of operations performed by the "fetch" code for x402.
Do not try to compile the project, I am doing that in another computer. Do not try to create a test for these changes, there are no unit/integration tests.
If you need to verify payloads, there are scripts in the docs/helpers folder. Also, store there any helper scripts you use to run on bash
Your task: identify why it is failing with Android and try to resolve the issue thinking step-by-step how to resolve it, updating related source code as necessary.


It is still not working. Error messages are in @log.txt
Let's try a new approach, create a new file named "SolanaPaymentBuilderSelfSigned.kt" which, instead of relying on the MWA to sign the X-payment, it uses a private key (hardcoded at the top) to sign the payload as it is done in the fetch/index.ts
Then, reference this new self signed code instead of the current implementation. Do not remove files, just skip using them to test if self-signing works.
Most probably, the server is using code similar to source in @docs/Coinbasex402/examples/typescript/facilitator/index.ts, review its dependencies to identify if there are insights on how to resolve this revolving issue. Code @docs/Coinbasex402/examples/typescript/servers/advanced/index.ts shows the backend server

The "Payment header" log still does not show the "==" at the end, is it correctly transformed to Base64?
Check the @docs/x402-Header.md which was contructed as documentation from the fetch example valid transaction flow

It is getting another type of error and I see the header using a lot of "QUFB" in the string sent to the server, whereas @docs/Coinbasex402/examples/typescript/clients/fetch/log.txt shows a simpler signature. What happens if you just remove all "QUFB" from the X-PAYMENT header? By the way, the fetch/log.txt is a succesful payment flow

docs/Coinbasex402/examples/typescript/clients/fetch/index.ts

https://hub.docker.com/r/mingc/android-build-box/

I am trying to debug a "client" application that is connecting to a x402 server using the "echo" using:
RESOURCE_SERVER_URL=https://x402.payai.network
ENDPOINT_PATH=/api/solana-devnet/paid-content
But, I can't get enough information on why it returns HTTP 502 as a response. I want you to check this repository "examples/typescript" and tell me which "server" or "facilitator" can I run to get more logs from that help me debug the client application.


I am having a lot of issues with the x402 in Kotlin. I am want you to deeply understand how the X-Payment header is contructed from scratch, EVERY SINGLE STEP, the code is @docs/Coinbasex402/examples/typescript/clients/fetch/index.ts
With it, I want you to create a "docs/x402-Header.md" file that explains how it is created and how it should look. For example, if the first step is "get the solana private key", then give an example of a private key: "which looks like XhEYFND...". If the next step is "sign an operation", then give an example of "the signature should have XXXYYYZZZ".
The source code is in @docs/Coinbasex402/ which should allow you to reconstruct every function called, with a function map of everything called. Also, you can run the example fetch/index.ts like this "root@816a864cd0b4:/proj/docs/Coinbasex402/examples/typescript/clients/fetch# npm run dev" (within that folder). The output gives an output like
@docs/Coinbasex402/examples/typescript/clients/fetch/log.txt
I am really interested in having all the information needed to reconstruct how the "X-PAYMENT-RESPONSE header" is created. This document will be crucial for reproducing the same effects with SolAIBot. At the moment, focus only on getting all the information needed from the fetch example. Also, if necessary, modify that file (index.ts) to log more details on
how the header is created.

I used another instance to search and try to find another solution, but so far there is no simpler solution to the reordeing problem. @log.txt showed that "sol4k" was the first option of Solana SDKSs.
To follow the "Manual Transaction Construction", consider that the whole source code of sol4K is in "docs/sol4k/src/main/kotlin/org/sol4k" which can be used to construct the transaction message with exact account order control. Follow that pattern and place all new necessary code inside "app/src/main/java/com/quantaliz/solaibot/data/x402"

Now that it is working as expected, flip the code to use MWA with the "SolanaPaymentBuilder.kt" instead of the self-signed version to test it works with it as well.

Using the MWA signer failed, while self-signed succeded. Identify why MWA fails and resolve it.
MWA logs: @log.txt
Self-signed: @logsuccess.txt
There you can compare what happened between executions

Now, it is using solflare instead of phantom to sign with MWA, it gives me this error: @log.txt

Now, when the user receives the response, they can't see the details of the transaction, like the premium content or confirmation hash. Also, the @screen.png shows the "FUNCTION_CALL" which should be "Calling... XXX" where XXX is the function to call, then a line break. When the wallet is called, "Processing wallet request..." needs a line break as well. Update the view to be more user friendly.

The @screen.png shows the "FUNCTION_CALL" still in the interface along now with "Calling..."
It might be that the LLM is adding the "FUNCTION_CALL" string before function call is being captured. Also, other strings do not have a line break despite putting it on the string (like "request...\n").
Find another location to update the code

File @app/src/main/java/com/quantaliz/solaibot/data/FunctionDeclarations.kt has the declaration of functions the LLM can call, I have commented unused function, this app will only support solana functions, other are not necessary. Update the system prompt with the solana functions as well as examples.

Identify if there are other places where functions like "get weather" and similar are called, then remove the code (and even commented one). Also remove the code related to "connect_solana", the app connects to the MWA when the user authorizes it

Add an extra "message bubble" for the "solana_payment" function with the response from the x402 service with its response details when the operation is successful. The user needs to see the hash of the transaction and the "premium" content

Project SolAIBot has @android/README.md & @android/AGENTS.md files as reference. Improve the README.md to be more enticing for Judges in a hackathon evaluating what has been done for the project so far, its characteristics and the fact that will be submitted for two hackathons (Cypherpunk & Hackaroo).

I made changes to the @android/README.md file. Now, adapt similar changes to the @solana-agent-kit/README.md although, yesterday we were doing most of it, just confirm the language remains similar between documents

This repository is the full submission for two hackathons (Cypherpunk & Hackaroo). Inside there two projects. The first project, SolAIBot has @android/README.md file as reference. The second project, solana-agent-kit, has @solana-agent-kit/README.md file explaining what has been done in these projects by Quantaliz. With that in mind, update @README.md to reflect the hard work made from both projects into a full hackathon submission.
Webpage for the Hackathon (webpage in https://Hackaroo.xyz) and Cyphepunk (webpage in https://www.colosseum.com/cypherpunk).

Using the context from
- @README.md
- @android/README.md
- @solana-agent-kit/README.md
Create a webpage that must follow the easthetic from @quantaliz.github.io
This page will be an static page be placed under github.io pages type.
This page, following the ideas from @context/PitchReference.md, should reflect all the hard work made for the hackathon.
Place this page inside the webpage folder.

We are working on improving the webpage inside @webpage/index.html which is an static page that promotes this repository.
Check @README.md for a refresher on the objectives to reach and why it matters.
Also, the @context/PitchReference.md has tips on how to make a good pitch for the hackathon.
There are some updates needed to the webpage:
- Make it more responsive, in particular if the user is watching it from a mobile phone. For example, when the browser is smaller, the images showing the app do not resize appropriately.
- Instead of having the screenshots at the top, move them into its own "Features/UX" section
- Sections like "Our Solution" or "What We've Built" have too many words, make setences more "engaging" and leave the details behind an "expandable" view if the user decides to get more details about it.
- The "Technology Stack" section is not necessary, remove it.
- Remove the "static" header on top and replace it a "sandwitch" button at the top left persistent section that, once pressed, it shows all the sections in the page.
- The "Complete Ecosystem Architecture" has a "AI Agents Ecosystem" map in markdown, but does not align with the webpage design, use something like "mermaid" or another text-based tool to improve the visuals of this graph.
- This presentation needs a market model: search the internet for the expected economic market of agents and payments
- This presentation needs a business model: SolAIBot as app will be free, but wallet transactions can be charged a fee as a x402 facilitator.
- This presentation needs a roadmap model: Define what can be done next for SolAIBot
Consider that any image referenced within this page should point to the "https://github.com/quantaliz/solaibot" repository instead of considering it is local.

Break down the "Features & User Experience" in two, first the "Features" with the squares like "privacy first, instant finality". Then another section named "User Experience" with the screenshots.

Break down the "Business Model" in two sections: One for the app, another for the fees
Place the "Roadmap" squares from "left -> right" instead top -> bottom

Remove the "static" header on top and replace it with a "sandwitch" button at the top left persistent section that, once pressed, it shows all the sections in the page.

Create a "video script" based on the contents of @webpage/hackathon.html and the @README.md file that is engaging, with simple words and would make the SolAIBot project shine, while the solana-agent-kit extensions a tool to extend the capacities of autonomous AI agents. Place the script in file "webpage/video-script.md" file.

Read the documentation within this URLs:
https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/text-to-speech
And store that documentation inside a single reference file in "webpage/voice/closedAI.md".

I am trying to create the voice for the "video script" @webpage/hume-video-script.md
Read the documentation @webpage/voice/closedAITTS.md
Explain there code samples as the documentation will focus on scripting.
The main focus should be on how to execute python script to make sections of text to a voice.

Now that you know how the hume service works and how to annotate an script, make a new document in the file "webpage/hume-video-script.md" file that uses those annotations for the video script @webpage/video-script.md
This new document should apply spaces, inflexions or emphasis on the key ideas to share with the SolAIBot video.

The file in "webpage/hume-video-script.md" should be a plug&play blob of text that will be fed into the playground of "hume.ai". It does not need to have the script structure. Consider what you wrote @webpage/humedocs/hume.md to annotate sentences instead of using the what every screen section does.

I am trying to create the voice for the "video script" @webpage/hume-video-script.md
The documentation for the service is @webpage/humedocs/hume.md
Currently, running the script at @webpage/voice/main.py fails to execute correctly with errors at @webpage/voice/log.txt
Make sure the script generates a "wav" or "mp3" in the "webpage/voice/output" folder. As is right now, it is not generating that file, it is just wasting tokens

I am trying to generate voice for the "video script" @webpage/hume-video-script.md
Read the documentation @webpage/voice/closedAITTS.md which has details that explains how the TTS service works
Therefore, create a file named @webpage/voice/main.py that:
- It reads the @webpage/hume-video-script.md
- The user can select the "SEGMENT" to create the speech
- Places the audio file in the /webpage/voice/output folder with the name "Segment_X" in "mp3" format
- Use "ballad" as the voice option

Make a new script similar to @demo/voice/main.py that, instead of reading the file @demo/hume-video-script.md it reads "@demo/solaibotDemo.md" and creates voice files according to each section.
This new script should be named "demo/voice/video-voice.py

My bad, it was @demo/video-script.md instead of solaibotDemo.md. Update the file to match "video-script.md". Also, allow the user to select which sections to recreate in case necessary, like the @demo/voice/demo-voice.py do


I ran @main.py and @client-sample.py in two terminals, but it failed. @log.txt has the traces of what happened. From what I read in the logs, it mentioned "Error creating signed transaction: 'solders.transaction.Transaction'" which should show more logs of what's happening, the client should only send a "signed" transaction to the merchant agent if it effectively signed it to then, send to the facilitator. Check the @docs/ClientMerchand.md as the paths to communicate betweeh merchant and client. If necessary, there are other md files in the docs folder.
What we are doing here is using uagents as the "messaging" platform for the x402 payment.
If you try to run code, use "cd /proj/uagentdemo && uv run ..." for the command you want to run with the libraries loaded, otherwise, you will enter a loop of failed transactions if you don't load the environment correctly

Now, it seems to remain stuck. @logClient.txt and @logMain.txt show how the merchant did not receive any payment but the client seems to keep waiting for it. Verify it works and that the client makes a payment and the merchant receives it by running these scripts in the background before telling me the code is correct

I ran @main.py and @client-sample.py in two terminals, but it failed. @logClient.txt & @logMain.txt have the traces of what happened.
First, the client should only run once, then log everything as "payment succeded" or "payment failed", with full addresses for on-chain devnet verification.
From what I read in the client logs, it mentioned "Error: Payment verification failed", the client "signed" transaction seems to be incomplete, with "..." signaling it could show more of the signature. Showing everything will help to debug it. Something on the merchant agent is not working well with the facilitator.
If necessary, check the @docs/ClientMerchant.md as the paths to communicate betweeh merchant and client. Also there are other md files in the docs folder.
What we are doing here is using uagents as the "messaging" platform for the x402 payment.
Make sure to run code using "uv run ..." for the command you want to run with the libraries loaded, otherwise, you will enter a loop of failed transactions if you don't load the environment correctly.
Also, before telling me it is resolved, run it yourself to confirm it is working as expected: Client ask -> Merchant requests payment -> Client sends signature -> Merchant verifies and gives access to premium resource

We are about to release the first version of the uagentdemo with x402 support. It consist of multiple files inside "src" (recent change) of which:
- @src/models.py  messaging classes
- @src/merchant.py the core sample code that offers the x402 functionality. It works in local mode, receiving messages directly or as a "proxy" from other agents
- @src/agentverse-proxy.py sample code that runs on agentverse.ai and forwards messages received to the merchant
Therefore, perform the following tasks:
- This code needs to be well documented.
- Make sure @.env.client.example & @.env.merchant.example match the required environment constants and it is well documented
- The merchant and the agentverse-proxy communicate using the "proxy" communication protocol, make sure documentation reflects that
- Update the @README.md file to explain how the project works and what needs to be done to replicate its execution in local mode.
- README.md should mention "this is a project for the hackathon explained here: "https://earn.superteam.fun/listing/asi-agents-track/", therefore, it should have professional language with focus on future work that will enhance the platform's experience and entice users/agents to use it
- Update @README-Agentverse.md to explain how the "proxy" messaging works and how to replicate the code using the agentverse.ai platform. Similar wording as the normal README.md and this will be published in the webpage platform.



There has been a change of plans, there is no need anymore for the @src/agentverse-proxy.py, I was able to deploy the full @src/merchant.py agent in agentverse. Now, make update to the README.md file signaling that the agent is live:
- https://agentverse.ai/agents/details/agent1qtem7xxuw9w65he0cr35u8r8v3fqhz6qh8qfhfl9u3x04m89t8dasd48sve/profile
- Agent Handle @x402merchant
- There won't be any need for the proxy/mailbox communication as everything will be handled directly by the @src/merchant.py file and the server running it's code
- Update the code to avoid any confusion with the proxy/mailbox code paths
- When you finish analyzing the code, remove the @src/agentverse-proxy.py file
- Add to the README.md file the @src/register.py step as metioned in the documentation here: "https://docs.agentverse.ai/documentation/launch-agents/connect-your-agents-chat-protocol-integration" in the step "You will now have to run the provided registration script. Copy and paste it on your end,"
- Make sure @src/client.py is aligned with all the changes to README.md or (if anything) to the merchant

I created a video with this @demo/video-script.md now I need the youtube description for that video. Consider the @README.md as reference of what's doing. Place a new file inside "demo/youtubedescription.md" file.

Here is the youtube video link: https://youtu.be/cwwICOWi-qE
Here is another demo video uploaded earlier: https://youtu.be/ieUBE9uDSwE
With these two, update the @webpage/hackathon.html webpage to show these links within.
The first link should be placed as a new section just after the first "Financially Autonomous AI Agents". Name this new section "SolAIBot Video Animation"
The second demo, should have a new section between "User Experience" & "Complete Ecosystem Architecture". Name this new section "Vide Demonstrations"

The current roadmap in the @wepbage/hackathon.html is really boring and not engaging. The content is fine but does not show actual progression at first sight. Change it to something like in this image @images/RoadmapSample.jpg This image is just a sample of how to improve the current content of the roadmap in the webpage. Try it

Add a new section to @webpage/hackathon.html before the Quantaliz logo at the end that gives an overview of the team:
- R. CEO & CTO. Use image: https://github.com/quantaliz/solaibot/blob/main/images/Chihuahua0.png?raw=true
- Dylen. COO. Use image: https://github.com/quantaliz/solaibot/blob/main/images/PekigneseBlue.png?raw=true
Make images the same size and place R & Dylen side by side.
Also, add "Special Thanks to" referencing people.
- Metasal Twitter @metalsal
- Notorious D.E.V. Twitter @notorious_d_e_v
- Darren Twitter @darrenrogan
Use the twitter image to jump to their twitter profile. This section should be small compared to the R & D

When the webpage loads, the video animation fails to load telling me "Error 153 Video player configuration error", what can be done about it?

This project now has a new demo, which is inside the uagentdemo folder. The @uagentdemo/README.md provides a general overview of what's happening to that subproject. Make sure to update the @README.md to reference what's been worked there, then forward people interested in knowing more to the @uagentdemo/README.md file. Make sure that wording in both documents feels consistent, considering as priority the one @README.md file and subordinate the one @uagentdemo/README.md
Along the same line, make sure it follows the patterns for the hackathon explained in @context/PitchReference.md

We need to update the app icon with the file "android/IconSolAIBot.png" as the app system icon, OS icon and launch animation. Make sure it complies with the required sizes. Use python if necessary to resize the image. Do not try to compile the app, I will do it in another computer

The first view is @android/app/src/main/java/com/quantaliz/solaibot/ui/llmchat/LlmChatTaskModule.kt which shows an icon above "SolAIBot". Replace that icon with the new app icon. Also, by default the app shows a navigation bar at the top, which is not needed in this view, can it be hidden?

To update your context on what we are working:
- Check the @Zerion-QuickStart.md @app/src/main/java/com/quantaliz/solaibot/data/zerion/Zerion-Integration.md @app/src/main/java/com/quantaliz/solaibot/data/zerion/README.md
- The "val key = apiKey ?: "YOUR_ZERION_API_KEY_HERE" should instead use the "@app/src/main/java/com/quantaliz/solaibot/data/zerion/ZerionConfig.kt" as the place where users compiling this app should update their API key, instead of code in the @app/src/main/java/com/quantaliz/solaibot/data/zerion/ZerionWalletFunctions.kt
- The line "const val API_KEY = "YOUR_ZERION_API_KEY_HERE" should make the app fail to compile and give a compilation error on why the user needs to replace the key.
- The file "@app/src/main/java/com/quantaliz/solaibot/data/FunctionDeclarations.kt" should remove "get_solana_balance" & "send_solana" function calls, keep only "solana_payment". The removed functions now will use the Zerion function calls.

To update your context on what we are working:
- Check the @Zerion-QuickStart.md @app/src/main/java/com/quantaliz/solaibot/data/zerion/Zerion-Integration.md @app/src/main/java/com/quantaliz/solaibot/data/zerion/README.md
- File @app/src/main/java/com/quantaliz/solaibot/data/zerion/ZerionWalletFunctions.kt returns "Function result: Wallet not connected." which is fine
- But then, the LLM seems to try to make another function call like `{"name": "get_balance", "parameters": {"token": "SOL"}}Calling... get_balance{"name": "get_balance", "parameters": {}}` which is wrong, The app should trigger a message tell the user to connect its solana wallet instead.
- Something similar is happening when the function call returns "return No token positions found for this wallet.", which tries to continue making function calls. Resolve this issue


When I ask the LLM this:
Tell me which transactions I have made in solana-devnet
It returns this: {"name": "get_transactions", "parameters": {"limit": "5"}}Calling... get_transactions{"name": "get_transactions", "parameters": {"limit": "
Which is wrong, tell me how to resolve this issue. First, the JSON before "Calling..." should be recognized by the code and not shown to the user. Then there is another "JSON" object that is truncated by the same LLM. @log.txt has the logs of what happened in code
With these, confirm that the list of "functionCall" listed in both "@app/src/main/java/com/quantaliz/solaibot/data/FunctionDeclarations.kt" & "@app/src/main/java/com/quantaliz/solaibot/ui/llmchat/LlmFunctionCallingModelHelper.kt" matches what is offered by @app/src/main/java/com/quantaliz/solaibot/data/SolanaWalletFunctions.kt & @app/src/main/java/com/quantaliz/solaibot/data/zerion/ZerionWalletFunctions.kt

Fortunatelly, the first JSON is not shown to the user anymore, however, it showed like this: "Calling... get_transactions{"name": "get_transactions", "parameters": {"limit": "5"}}". In the logs it mentions there is "No transactions found for this wallet", which the LLM did not catch as finish this flow.
Also, make sure to remove references to "FUNCTION_CALL" previous way to call functions, now it is using json responses directly. You can find staled documentation in @README.md

The @app/src/main/java/com/quantaliz/solaibot/data/zerion/README.md provides a summary of the zerion API. Or @docs/zerion/llms.txt provides references to all documentation. I am sure the solana wallet has transactions, but the API result tells me it does not, which is wrong, because it is calling the connected wallet and not the one on the prompt. See the @log.txt for it
Something similar might be happening to other zerion functions, that are not "generic" enough if the user makes a call and they don't fill the request accordingly. So, check that functions listed in @app/src/main/java/com/quantaliz/solaibot/data/zerion/ZerionWalletFunctions.kt are correctly aligned. The only hardcoded requirement is to use "solana" as the blockchain to request

If necessary, you can try to call @docs/zerion/zerion.sh with the correct.

I tried now "Get the porfolio of ", then the response was incorrect: "Calling... get_portfolioError fetching portfolio: Unexpected JSON token at offset 378: Expected start of the object '{', but had '3' instead at path: $.data.attributes.positions_distribution_by_type['wallet'] JSON input: .....: { "wallet": 328.38235663737044, .....". @log.txt has the traces of what happened. Resolve this request
